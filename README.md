# CONCLAVE_MICRO-MOUSE
This project aims to make a diffrential drive robot move on the shortest path in a given maze using ROS and Gazebo. The top view of the maze is captured using a camera and the image is processed using Computer Vision, providing the shortest path to traverse. This path is then communicated to the robot in the Gazebo world to solve the maze.
